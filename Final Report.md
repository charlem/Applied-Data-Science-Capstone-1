# Final Report â€“ The Battle of the Neighborhoods

## Introduction & Business Problem:
New York City and Tokyo are two of the most crowded and expensive cities all over the world. This work will be focused on analyzing and visualizing popular venues of these two cities using users' check-ins information. Users' behaviour and trend are also studied in details. Hopefully, the analysis can give valuable insights about the life and economy of each city, helping decision making for business. Policy-making might be benefical as well from deep understanding of citizens' habits.

The main business accompanied in this work is what the most popular venues and where they are. This can be gainned by check-ins information of users. And from which, business making decision can be made based on which might be good venues but not yet existed and where are potential locations for them. However, the lack of certain types of venues can also mean that there is no demand for them. Furthermore, location hotspots will be also created, giving some ideas of when are the most preferable time people tend to do the activities. From which the most crowded spots could be identified and visualized using Foursquare location data.
